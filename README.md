# Reaper Scripts
My Reaper scripts for automate creation of multitrack show projects, using Lua language.

You can download then individually, or you can use with [Reapack extension](https://reapack.com/).

With Reapack installed, just import my repository [index.xml](https://github.com/joabeslopes/Reaper-scripts-multitrack-show/raw/main/index.xml) into it, then browse for "Joabe Lopes" and all my scripts will be there, with the instructions for use inside then.

All these scripts are licensed under GPL version 3, what means you can use, modify and distribute (even sell) your changes of these scripts, but you need to mantain then under this license.

It's fair enough.
